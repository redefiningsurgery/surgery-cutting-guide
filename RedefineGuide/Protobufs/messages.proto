/**
 Contains protobuf messages sent back and forth between the app and server.

 All matrices are stored in row-major order as a 1D array, so the first row is stored first, then the second row, and so on.  The number of columns and rows are stored in separate fields.

 To generate the code for this file is below.  Note you must be in the same directory as the proto file:
 Swift: `protoc --swift_out=. messages.proto`
 Python: `protoc --python_out=. messages.proto`

Note: currently this file is in two repositories, one for Swift and one for Python.  The Swift version is the master, and the Python version is copied from the Swift version.  If you make changes to this file, please copy the changes to the other repository.
